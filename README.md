Description of the Problem
Africa faces significant challenges in aligning its growing workforce with the skill demands of various industries. With a rapidly changing economic landscape and increasing demand for skilled labor, there is a pressing need for targeted training and policy development. However, a lack of comprehensive understanding of the relationships between job-required skills and regional demands creates inefficiencies in workforce development. This project aims to bridge that gap by analyzing skill relationships across job types and mapping them to specific regions in Africa to guide strategic workforce development.
 
Basic Features (Functionality)
•	Parse and process skill data from data/Skills.xlsx, create a weighted skill network graph, and incorporate regional segmentation for mapping.
•	Provide context and insights into regional economic conditions and labor market trends in Africa, ensuring that the data is interpreted within the correct regional frameworks.
•	Develop an interactive skill network visualization that includes geographic overlays to map skill demand across Africa’s regions.
•	Build a user interface that allows stakeholders to interact with the skill network, input skills for analysis, and view regional insights.
 
Nice-to-Have Features (Functionality)

Implement a recommendation engine to suggest skill development courses based on skill co-occurrence data.
Integrate real-time labor market data to provide up-to-date insights on emerging skills in high-demand sectors across African regions.
Create an interactive map that allows users to zoom into specific regions and dynamically view the regional skill network and job types.
Develop a reporting module that generates downloadable reports detailing skill relationships and regional workforce recommendations.
 
Anticipated Challenges
There are a few challenges I foresee in this project. On the technical side, handling diverse datasets—especially if the regional data or industry-specific information isn't fully available or well-structured—might require advanced data processing techniques, which could slow things down initially.

4. User Interface Development

Front-End Framework: To allow stakeholders to interact with the skill network, a user interface (UI) will be developed. This will likely require a combination of front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React or Django to create the web application.
UI/UX Design: Creating an intuitive user interface that enables seamless interaction with the skill network, input of skills for analysis, and viewing of regional insights will require close collaboration with UI/UX designers.

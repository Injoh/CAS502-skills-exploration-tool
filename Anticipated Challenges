Anticipated Challenges:

Data Availability and Quality: Ensuring access to comprehensive, high-quality data is crucial for the project's success. Incomplete or poorly structured data may require extensive preprocessing.
Integration of Disparate Data Sources: Data coming from various regions may be formatted differently, requiring standardization and harmonization to integrate them into a cohesive analysis.
Scalability: As the data grows, ensuring the scalability of the network analysis and interactive maps will be important to provide smooth user experiences without slowdowns.

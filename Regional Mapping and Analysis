Regional Mapping and Analysis

Geographic Data Integration: The project needs to overlay skill data on a map of Africa, incorporating regional variations. This will require geographic mapping tools such as folium or plotly for creating interactive maps with skill distributions.
Economic and Labor Insights: Regional economic conditions, which will impact skill demands, need to be analyzed. This could involve external sources such as World Bank reports or national labor statistics, and understanding these factors will be critical for providing accurate regional insights.

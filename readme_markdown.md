# Strategic Workforce Development through Skill Network Analysis and Regional Mapping

This repository contains the project code and documentation for our initiative to address workforce development challenges in Africa by analyzing skill relationships and mapping them to specific regions.

## Description of the Problem

Africa faces significant challenges in aligning its growing workforce with the skill demands of various industries. With a rapidly changing economic landscape and an increasing demand for skilled labor, there is a pressing need for targeted training and policy development. However, a lack of comprehensive understanding of the relationships between job-required skills and regional demands creates inefficiencies in workforce development. This project aims to bridge that gap by:

- Analyzing skill relationships across job types.
- Mapping these relationships to specific regions in Africa.
- Providing actionable insights to guide strategic workforce development.

## Basic Features (Functionality)

- **Data Parsing and Processing:**  
  Parse and process skill data from `data/Skills.xlsx`, create a weighted skill network graph, and incorporate regional segmentation for mapping.

- **Contextual Regional Insights:**  
  Provide context and insights into regional economic conditions and labor market trends in Africa, ensuring that the data is interpreted within the correct regional frameworks.

- **Interactive Visualization:**  
  Develop an interactive skill network visualization that includes geographic overlays to map skill demand across Africa’s regions.

- **User Interface:**  
  Build a user interface that allows stakeholders to interact with the skill network, input skills for analysis, and view regional insights.

## Nice-to-Have Features (Functionality)

- **Recommendation Engine:**  
  Implement a recommendation engine to suggest skill development courses based on skill co-occurrence data.

- **Real-Time Data Integration:**  
  Integrate real-time labor market data to provide up-to-date insights on emerging skills in high-demand sectors across African regions.

- **Interactive Regional Map:**  
  Create an interactive map that allows users to zoom into specific regions and dynamically view the regional skill network and job types.

- **Reporting Module:**  
  Develop a reporting module that generates downloadable reports detailing skill relationships and regional workforce recommendations.

## Anticipated Challenges

There are a few challenges we foresee in this project:

1. **Technical Challenge:**  
   Handling diverse datasets—especially if the regional or industry-specific data isn't fully available or well-structured—might require advanced data processing techniques, potentially slowing initial development.

2. **Process Challenge:**  
   Coordinating collaboration between team members with different areas of expertise (data science, regional economics, UI development) could lead to misaligned priorities and communication issues.

3. **Team Composition Challenge:**  
   Discrepancies in skills among team members might create gaps, especially when translating technical analyses into actionable regional insights.

## Team Collaboration and Communication Plan

We plan to maintain close collaboration using the following methods:

- **Weekly Zoom Meetings:**  
  We will meet once a week on [Zoom](https://zoom.us) to discuss progress, review findings, and align on next steps.

- **Daily Communication:**  
  Slack will be our primary tool for day-to-day updates, sharing documents, and addressing any challenges immediately.

- **Individual Repositories with Shared Content:**  
  Each team member will maintain their own repository containing the same content. We will ensure consistency by syncing commits and helping each other resolve any issues.

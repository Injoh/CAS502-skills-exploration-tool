8. Team Collaboration and Version Control

Version Control: Each team member will maintain their own repository to ensure accountability and consistency across the project. GitHub or GitLab can be used to track changes, with regular pull requests and merges to ensure synchronization of work.
Documentation: Clear documentation of each step of the process will be essential, especially for sharing knowledge between team members. This includes not only code but also decisions made throughout the project.

2. Skill Network Graph Creation

Graph Construction: The core functionality involves creating a weighted skill network graph. This requires the identification of skill relationships (e.g., which skills co-occur in specific jobs or regions). Libraries like NetworkX in Python would be essential for graph creation and analysis.
Skill Weighting and Evaluation: Defining how skills are weighted (based on frequency, importance, or region-specific demand) will require setting criteria. This might involve statistical analysis or machine learning models for skill ranking and clustering.
